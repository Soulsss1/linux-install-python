## Installation Kivy and Buildozer on Ubuntu 18.04 based distros

The kivy-buildozer-installer.sh installs Kivy framework and Buildozer for Python 3 with all its dependecies.

The script was successfully tested with Xubuntu 18.04 and Lubuntu 18.04. The test result was a successfully compiled .apk file for Android 6.0 and 7.0.

1. Download the [**kivy-buildozer-installer.sh**](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/zaemiel/kivy-buildozer-installer/master/kivy-buildozer-installer.sh) any way you like. E.g.

    ```curl -LJO https://raw.githubusercontent.com/zaemiel/kivy-buildozer-installer/master/kivy-buildozer-installer.sh```

2. Add execution permissions:

    ```chmod +x kivy-buildozer-installer.sh```

3. Run the script:

    ```sudo ./kivy-buildozer-installer.sh```


**WARNING**
With manual installation of the Buildozer via cloning its repository, pay attention to clone the Buildozer repository to any directory except HOME directory. Otherwise the error "**AttributeError 'Namespace' object has no attribute 'ignore-setup_py'**" will occur probably due importing modules conflicts.
